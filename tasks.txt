DONE:
1) Column that shows all the labs the student is enrolled in on the left hand side of the canvas.
2) Also show the graphs that are within the selected lab
3) Components can only attach to a SWITCH (VLAN).\

1) Validate names by checking if name exists increase counter
2) Validate renaming
3) Anything that is not a switch can have up to 4 interfaces (And make this variable configurable)
4) Make edges be eth connections and have them hold a dropdown for interface, ip textfield, netmask, etc...

TODO:
- Fix COPY PASTE name error
- Fix EDGE inaccurate error messages
- Remove HTML code from XML and generate it dynamically at runtime.
- change the cell configuration TYPE to dropdown
- Mouse over any object will pop up a floating tooltip, disable that tooltip

FUTURE MODIFICATIONS:
- Make loading screen appear onCHANGE instead of after ajax call response.
I also need to figure out how to do the ajax call ASYNCHRONOUSLY. (DONE)
- Use jquery fadein and fadeout rather than jgraph's effects for loading screen (DONE)
